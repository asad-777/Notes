# Variables

There are three methods to declare variables in JavaScript

| Name  | Scope    | Reassign able | Hoisted   |
| ----- | -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| const | block    | no            | yes (tdz) |
| let   | block    | yes           | yes (tdz) |
| var   | function | yes           | yes       |

- Tdz = temporal dead zone hoisted, hoisted but can't be accessed before declaration

```javascript

```
